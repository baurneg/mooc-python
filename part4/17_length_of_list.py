# Please write a function named length which takes a list 
# as its argument and returns the length of the list.

# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# result = length(my_list))
# print("The length is", result)

# # the list given as an argument doesn't need to be stored 
# in any variable
# result = length([1, 1, 1, 1])
# print("The length is", result)
# Sample output
# The length is 5
# The length is 4

def length(my_list):
    return len(my_list)

# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
my_list = [3, 6, -4]
result = length(my_list)
print(result)
