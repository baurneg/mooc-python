# Please write a program which asks the user to input a string. 
# The program then prints out different messages if the string 
# contains any of the vowels a, e or o.

# You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. 
# Have a look at the examples below.

# Sample output
# Please type in a string: hello there
# a not found
# e found
# o found

# Sample output
# Please type in a string: hiya
# a found
# e not found
# o not found

string = input("Please type in a string: ")
if "a" in string:
  print("a found")
else:
  print("a not found")
if "e" in string:
  print("e found")
else:
  print("e not found")
if "o" in string:
  print("o found")
else:
  print("o not found")
  
# string = input("Please type in a string: ")
# vowels = "aeo"
# index = 0
 
# while index < len(vowels):
#     vowel = vowels[index]
#     if vowel in string:
#         print(vowel, "found")
#     else:
#         print(vowel, "not found")
#     index += 1
