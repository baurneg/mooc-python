# Please write a function named print_many_times(text, times), 
# which takes a string and an integer as arguments. The integer 
# argument specifies how many times the string argument should be printed out:

# print_many_times("hi", 5)

# print()

# text = "All Pythons, except one, grow up"
# times = 3
# print_many_times(text, times)
# Sample output
# hi
# hi
# hi
# hi
# hi

# All Pythons, except one, grow up.
# All Pythons, except one, grow up.
# All Pythons, except one, grow up.
