# Please write a program which asks the user to type in an integer number. 
# If the user types in a number equal to or below 0, the execution ends. 
# Otherwise the program prints out the factorial of the number.

# The factorial of a number involves multiplying the number by all the 
# positive integers smaller than itself. In other words, it is the product 
# of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For example, 
# the factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

# Some examples of expected behaviour:

# Sample output
# Please type in a number: 3
# The factorial of the number 3 is 6
# Please type in a number: 4
# The factorial of the number 4 is 24
# Please type in a number: -1
# Thanks and bye!

# Sample output
# Please type in a number: 1
# The factorial of the number 1 is 1
# Please type in a number: 0
# Thanks and bye!



while True:
  number = int(input("Please type in a number: "))
  factorial = 1
  index = 1

  if number <= 0:
    print("Thanks and bye!")
    break

  while number >= index:
    factorial *= index
    index += 1

  print(f"The factorial of the number {number} is {factorial}")
